#Technical Plan

##Pages Need + Production Notes
(initial brainstorm)
-index.html - user page/game
-results.html - result page
-app.js
-api.js
-arrayMethods.js
-styles.css
-reset.css

-Local Stages:
how many times a product appears incremented after each appearance
how many times a product is selected incremented after each selection
number of presentations which will be incremented after each appearance
when the picture was last shown (3 in a spread) - needs to be updated before each increment
The other images appearing in the three image spread will need to be incrememted

-Global
If it was clicked

##Variables Needed/Methods/Notes
What variables will need to be used to track data:
make an api which will include, Id, image, and name.
next display 3 images on a page: will need
productID, random picture picker, html image tag with source.
After we display images we need to collect user input
set up another set, repeat untill we reach 25 rounds.

-End of result display
randomProduct - to generate randomness
